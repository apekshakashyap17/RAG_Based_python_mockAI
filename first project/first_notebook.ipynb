It’s simple to use, packed with features and supported by a wide range of libraries and frameworks. Its clean syntax makes it beginner-friendly. A high-level language, used in data science, automation, AI, web development and more.Known for its readability, which means code is easier to write, understand and maintain.Backed by strong library support, we don’t have to build everything from scratch.Basic Code ExampleThe following is a simple program that displays the message “Hello, World!” on the screen.\n",
